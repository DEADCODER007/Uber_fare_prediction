Okay first observations before EDA-
->no of passengers of considerable use
->Coords:
    coords can help in making distance feature
    two different distances 1)Manhattan 2)Euclidean 3)Haversine

->Key:
    its unlikely but key might correspond to person's id and membership or something for frequent travellers may reduce fare
    key has only 3600 values , so we will check how it is related to address for imputing it. But we need to convert it to some meaningful numerical feature

->Date Time:
    the date time columns could be of use for i)hardcoding holidays and increased rates ii)night/early morning time when rides are expensive
    since holidays are just outliers and diffuclt to tag, label them sunday/workingday(1/0) 
    seperate time intervals into shifts which will be distributed based on kmeans clustering results
    seperate date and time columns(dates for inflation in price and time for shifts)
    not much pattern observed in fare amount with time so dividing them into hours(1,2,3...24)

->unnamed 0 column no clue , we will get to know from website or after EDA(right now observed all are values are unique)
