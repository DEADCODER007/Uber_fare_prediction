Okay first observations before EDA-
->no of passengers of considerable use
->coords can help in making distance feature
->its unlikely but key might correspond to person's id and membership or something for frequent travellers may reduce fare
->the date time columns could be of use for i)hardcoding holidays and increased rates ii)night/early morning time when rides are expensive
->unnames column no clue , we will get to know from website or after EDA
