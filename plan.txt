Okay first observations before EDA-
->no of passengers of considerable use
->coords can help in making distance feature
->two different distances 1)Manhattan 2)Euclidean
->its unlikely but key might correspond to person's id and membership or something for frequent travellers may reduce fare
->the date time columns could be of use for i)hardcoding holidays and increased rates ii)night/early morning time when rides are expensive
->since holidays are just outliers and diffuclt to tag, label them sunday/workingday(1/0) 
->seperate time intervals into shifts which will be distributed based on kmeans clustering results
->unnames column no clue , we will get to know from website or after EDA
